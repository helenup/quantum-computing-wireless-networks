## 📖 Overview  
A concise paragraph (2–3 sentences) describing:
- the high-level problem your thesis addresses  
- why quantum methods are promising for wireless networks  
- what this repo contains (simulations, notebooks, data-processing scripts, etc.)

## 🗂️ Repository Structure  
The folders **Quantum Euclidean Distance**, **Multi-Objective QAOA**, and **Quantum ML MIMO-NOMA** each encapsulate a distinct use case developed as part of this thesis research.
